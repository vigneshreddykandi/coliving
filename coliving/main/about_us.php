            <div class="story_title">Our Story</div>
            <div class="story_text">The idea of building the largest platform of coliving homes began in a Menlo Park startup house in the winter of 2014. Our founder Daniel Beck was visiting Silicon Valley for the first time and more than the Golden Gate bridge or the Apple campus, what marked him were the countless driven and optimistic people he met while staying there. As exciting as it is, working remotely while traveling or moving to a new city for a fresh start can also be lonely and disheartening. At Coliving.com it is our goal to connect the new generation of workers to the communities made for them.
